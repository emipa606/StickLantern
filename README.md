update B19

Add a new light source, stick lantern

It is constructed with 20 pieces of wood and 20 pieces of steel.

It's longer than a torch and it does not turn off when it rains !!!

I think it's compatible with existing save files.

Languages: English, 한국어, 日本語, 简体中文,

Thanks Google translation!
